# Welcome to LLILC
## Introduction
LLILC is an **LL**VM based MS**IL** **C**ompiler - we pronounce it 'lilac' - with a goal of producing a set of cross-platform .NET code generation tools. Today LLILC is being developed against the [dotnet/CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) for use as a JIT, but an ahead of time (AOT) compiler planned for the future.  

See the [wiki](https://github.com/dotnet/llilc/wiki) for more information.  It has a more complete discussion of our background and goals as well as "getting started" details and developer information.

## Supported platforms
Our initial supported platform is Windows, but Linux and Mac OSX support is under development.


## Contributions
LLILC is just starting up.  Only a few tests are working and there are lots of future work to do.  Please see our [issues](https://github.com/dotnet/llilc/issues) or the [contributing page](https://github.com/dotnet/llilc/wiki/Contributing) for how to pitch in.
